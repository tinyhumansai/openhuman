# Privacy mode

Most assistants' privacy story is a paragraph in a system prompt. OpenHuman's is an enforcement point in the Rust core.

The `[security.privacy]` config block defines three modes:

| Mode | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `standard` (default) | Normal operation. Managed cloud routing, BYO providers and local models are all available. |
| `local_only` | No inference leaves the device. Every external chat provider is refused when it is built: the managed cloud, BYO cloud keys, even CLI delegates like Claude Code. Network tools, web search, integrations and cloud embeddings are refused at their egress points. Only local runtimes pass: Ollama, LM Studio, MLX and local OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Voice is the one exception, because no local speech-to-text engine exists. |
| `sensitive` | The base for an upcoming PII-aware tier (detection, redaction, destination disclosure). Today it behaves like `standard`. |

## Why enforcement matters

Privacy mode is not a policy the model is asked to follow. The first check lives in the inference provider factory (`crates/openhuman-core/src/inference/provider/factory/`). Under `local_only`, the core refuses to build an external provider at all. The error names the blocked provider and tells you how to fix it: switch to a local model, or change the mode in Settings.

That makes the guarantee independent of prompts, agents, tools or upstream bugs. If any code path tries to reach a cloud model in local-only mode, it cannot get a client.

`local_only` is also enforced at the egress points where the agent sends your data anywhere else (`crates/openhuman-core/src/security/egress/enforce.rs`):

| Egress point | Behavior under `local_only` |
| --- | --- |
| Network tools (`http_request`, `web_fetch`, `curl`) | Refused, with a policy-blocked message in the tool result |
| Web search (Exa, Tavily) | Refused the same way                                      |
| Composio tool calls and integration requests | Refused with an error                                     |
| Cloud embeddings | Refused with an error                                     |
| Local runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, MLX, local OpenAI-compatible) | Always permitted, nothing leaves the device               |

One deliberate exemption: backend control-plane round-trips keep flowing. These are sign-in, session, team, billing, and integration connection management and catalog reads. Blocking them breaks the app for no privacy gain. They carry auth tokens, ids and routing metadata, never user content.

Speech-to-text is not covered by `local_only`. There is no local speech-to-text engine, so dictation and transcription leave the device through the hosted OpenHuman STT proxy or the third-party STT provider you configured. Disable the voice component if your threat model requires all speech processing to stay local.

Privacy mode governs data egress. It is separate from the [autonomy tiers](approval-gate.md) (readonly, supervised, full), which govern what the agent may do. You can run a fully autonomous agent that never sends a byte of inference off-device.

## Pairing it with local models

Local-only mode works with [local AI](model-routing/local-ai.md). OpenHuman does not install runtimes or download models, so you set these up yourself before turning it on:

- Chat and reasoning on a runtime you run (Ollama, LM Studio, MLX, OMLX, or another OpenAI-compatible server), with the models you pulled, added as a provider under **Connections → LLM**.
- Piper text-to-speech, if you install the Piper binary and a voice yourself and set `PIPER_BIN`.
- Memory on a CortexDB endpoint you run yourself. The hosted TinyHumans engine is a cloud call, so local-only mode blocks it.

With local-only on, a workload routed to a runtime that is not running, or to a model you have not pulled, fails instead of falling back to the cloud.

See [Use OpenHuman with a local model](../guides/local-model.md) for a full local setup, and [Keep sensitive data private](../guides/privacy-sensitive-data.md) for a broader privacy walkthrough.
