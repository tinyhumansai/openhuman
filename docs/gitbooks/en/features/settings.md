# Settings

Settings is a two-pane screen with a grouped rail on the left and one panel on the right. It holds what changes how the app behaves. What the agent can reach lives in [Connections](connections.md), and most of the old settings addresses for those now redirect there.

Open it with the gear in the sidebar header, or `⌘,`.

## The groups

### General

| Panel | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Who you are signed in as, your plan and usage, team, devices, notifications and language. |
| Privacy | [Privacy mode](privacy-mode.md) and what may leave the machine. |
| Migration | Moving your data folder, and importing from an earlier version. |
| Core | Point the app at a core running somewhere else: its RPC URL, a bearer token and a live reachability check. |
| Feedback | Send feedback from inside the app. |
| About | Version, build, licenses and the capability catalog. |

### Appearance

| Panel | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| Appearance | Font size (including a custom pixel value), layout corners and borders, and language. |
| Theme Studio | Theme family and variant, per-token colors, per-role fonts, backdrop and your own saved themes. See [Themes](theming.md). |
| Personality | The editable `SOUL.md` prompt and its companion identity file. See [Personalization](personalization.md). |
| Face | Which mascot, its colors, a second "duo" mascot, a custom image and its voice. See [The mascot](mascot/README.md). |

### Security

| Panel | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| Keychain | The OS keyring, consent, and what is encrypted at rest. See [OS keyring and secret storage](os-keyring-and-secret-storage.md). |
| Agent access | Trusted roots and their read or write grant, the always-allow list, the blanket auto-approve switch, action and tool timeouts, the workspace-only switch and the tool-call dialect. |
| Sandbox | Which sandbox backend a session gets, and its limits. |
| Approval history | The audit trail of approval decisions and their outcomes. |

## Where the autonomy tier is

It is not in Agent access, which is where most people look first.

The tier (`readonly`, `supervised` or `full`) has no control in the normal settings navigation. The panel with the radios is developer-only and reachable only as a hidden deep link, so it does not appear in the sidebar. Set the tier in `config.toml`:

```toml
[security.autonomy]
enabled = true          # off by default; nothing below applies until this is true
level = "supervised"
```

`[security.autonomy] enabled` is `false` out of the box. Until you turn the policy on, the trusted roots, the always-allow list and the workspace-only switch in Agent access do nothing. [Approval gate](approval-gate.md) explains the whole model, including what stays enforced either way.

## Redirects

The panels moved into [Connections](connections.md), and the old addresses still work. Many more settings routes redirect than render. The main ones:

| Old address | Now |
| --- | --- |
| `/settings/llm`, `/settings/embeddings`, `/settings/voice`, `/settings/search` | Connections, the matching API-keys tab |
| `/settings/agents/*`, `/settings/tools` | Connections → Tools |
| `/settings/memory-*`, `/settings/intelligence` | Connections → Memory |
| `/settings/mcp-server`, `/settings/skills-runner` | Connections → MCP Servers, Connections → Skills |
| `/settings/wallet-balances` | Connections → Wallet Balances |
| `/settings/cron-jobs` | Workflows → Schedules |
| `/settings/automations` | Workflows |
| `/settings/team`, `/settings/billing`, `/settings/notifications`, `/settings/devices`, `/settings/language` | Settings → Account |

## Not here yet

Settings has no search. Notification categories gate which events are ingested, but the page that edited them is gone, so they are config-only today.
