# permissions

Tauri v2 permission sets for the app's own commands (the ones registered in
`generate_handler!` in [`src/lib.rs`](../src/lib.rs)). Each `.toml` file defines one
`[[permission]]` with an `identifier` and a `[permission.commands] allow`
list. The capability in [`../capabilities/default.json`](../capabilities/README.md)
grants all of them to the `main` and `overlay` windows by identifier.

## How it works

`tauri_build::build()` (called from [`build.rs`](../build.rs)) reads this directory into the
app's ACL manifest under the `__app-acl__` key; `build.rs` reruns when the
directory changes. Once that manifest exists, Tauri checks app commands
against it on every invoke, not only plugin commands. A command the webview
calls is allowed only if some permission granted by a capability lists it.
Otherwise the invoke fails with "`<command>` not allowed. Command not found",
even though the command is registered.

```text
renderer invoke('gateway_list')
   |
   v
RuntimeAuthority::resolve_access
   |  capability "default" (windows: main, overlay)
   |    -> allow-core-process, allow-app-update, ... (these files)
   |  command listed in one of them?  yes -> run handler
   v                                   no  -> "not allowed. Command not found"
```

## Layout

| File | Identifier | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`allow-core-process.toml`](allow-core-process.toml) | `allow-core-process` | Core endpoint and lifecycle (`core_rpc_*`, `relay_http_rpc`, `relay_remote_socket`, `start_core_process`, `restart_core_process`, `reset_local_data`), app control (`restart_app`, `app_quit`), session (`get_active_user_id`, `auth_*`), dictation and push-to-talk hotkeys, `show_ptt_overlay`, `activate_main_window`, notch window, native notifications, and log folder commands. |
| [`allow-app-update.toml`](allow-app-update.toml) | `allow-app-update` | `check_app_update`, `apply_app_update`, `download_app_update`, `install_app_update`. |
| [`allow-workspace-files.toml`](allow-workspace-files.toml) | `allow-workspace-files` | `open_workspace_path`, `reveal_workspace_path`, `preview_workspace_text`. |
| [`allow-artifact-download.toml`](allow-artifact-download.toml) | `allow-artifact-download` | `download_artifact_to_downloads`, `save_artifact_as`. |
| [`allow-directory-picker.toml`](allow-directory-picker.toml) | `allow-directory-picker` | `pick_directory_via_dialog`. |
| [`allow-loopback-oauth.toml`](allow-loopback-oauth.toml) | `allow-loopback-oauth` | `start_loopback_oauth_listener`, `stop_loopback_oauth_listener`. Kept separate so a consumer of `allow-core-process` does not also get OAuth listener control. |

## Adding a command

1. Register it in `generate_handler!` in [`src/lib.rs`](../src/lib.rs).
2. Add its name to the `allow` list of the permission file that fits, or add
   a new file and reference its identifier from [`capabilities/default.json`](../capabilities/default.json).
3. Rebuild. Step 2 is the one that is easy to miss: the build succeeds and the
   call only fails at runtime.

## Gotchas

These files have drifted from `generate_handler!` (checked against
`src/lib.rs` when this README was written).

Registered commands that no permission lists, so the webview cannot call them:
`gateway_list`, `gateway_save`, `gateway_delete`, `gateway_activate`,
`gateway_active`, `gateway_status`, `mcp_resolve_binary_path`,
`mcp_open_client_config`, `claude_code_login_launch`, `mascot_window_show`,
`mascot_window_hide`, `set_titlebar_for_sidebar`, `recover_port_conflict`,
`force_quit_port_owner`, `check_core_update`, `apply_core_update`,
`process_diagnostics_list_owned`, `overlay_parent_rpc_url`.

Listed commands that are no longer registered, which are harmless but stale:
`service_install_direct`, `service_start_direct`, `service_stop_direct`,
`service_status_direct`, `service_uninstall_direct`,
`register_companion_hotkey`, `unregister_companion_hotkey`,
`companion_activate`, `companion_start_session`, `companion_stop_session`,
`companion_status`, `companion_config_get`, `companion_config_set`.

Plugin permissions (`core:*`, `notification:*`, `opener:*`, `deep-link:*`,
`updater:*`) are not defined here; they come from the plugins and are granted
directly in the capability.
