//! Errors a harness can produce.
//!
//! Split from [`CoreError`] rather than folded into it because the two answer
//! different questions. `CoreError` is about a *call*: the domain rejected it,
//! the method is not in this build, the facade's serde broke. `HarnessError`
//! adds the failures that happen before any call exists — laying out a
//! workspace, copying skills, discovering that a second core is already running
//! in this process.
//!
//! [`HarnessError::Call`] carries `CoreError` through unchanged, so a host that
//! already matches on `Unavailable` or on a domain `kind` keeps doing so.
