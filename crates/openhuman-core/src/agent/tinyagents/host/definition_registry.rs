//! Host implementation of the TinyAgents **agent catalogue** seam.
//!
//! Adapts two OpenHuman domains onto
//! [`tinyagents_harness::host::DefinitionRegistry`]:
//!
//! * [`crate::agent::harness::definition::AgentDefinitionRegistry`] —
//!   the harness registry of built-in ([`load_builtins`](crate::agent::registry::agents::load_builtins)-parsed
//!   `agent.toml`)
//!   and workspace-override agent definitions, plus the config-backed
//!   user-authored fallback
//!   ([`crate::agent::registry::find_custom_in_config`] →
//!   [`crate::agent::registry::definition_from_registry_entry`]).
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. The crate-side
//! [`AgentDefinition`] is inert (`serde` + `std`); OpenHuman's harness
//! definition is far richer (prompt builders, sandbox mode, iteration policy,
//! TokenJuice profile, turn graph). Only the six fields the turn loop can act
//! on cross the seam; everything else stays host-side by design.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches resolved here
//!
//! **1. Absence must never be an error.** OpenHuman's own catalogue relies on
//! this: an agent may list a subagent id that a feature gate compiled out of
//! the build (`presentation_agent` without `documents`), and both existing resolution sites
//! tolerate it (`collect_orchestrator_tools` warns and skips;
//! [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy) explicitly `continue`s past unknown ids). So
//! `OpenHumanDefinitionRegistry::resolve` returns `Ok(None)` for every miss
//! and this adapter has no error path at all.
//!
//! **2. Declared vs authorized subagents.** The crate's
//! `AgentDefinition::subagents` is only what an agent *declares*;
//! `delegates_for` must return the **authorized** set. OpenHuman's authority is
//! the tier hierarchy, so `delegates_for` applies
//! [`validate_tier_transition`](crate::agent::harness::definition::validate_tier_transition)
//! — the same single source of truth
//! [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy) walks at boot — per declared pair. A `Worker`
//! parent yields an empty list; a tier-illegal child is dropped. Unknown child
//! ids are **kept**, matching both [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy)'s `continue` and
//! the trait's note that an authorized id may still fail to resolve.
//!
//! **3. Tool scopes remain host-materialized.** The portable definition
//! carries an explicit named scope, after the host applies discovery,
//! companion-tool and denylist policy. Wildcards are materialized against
//! [`Self::with_registered_tools`] and fail closed when no catalogue exists.
//! Empty scopes retain [`NO_TOOLS_SENTINEL`] for compatibility with the host's
//! existing tool visibility contract; they never become portable wildcards.
//!
//! **4. `SubagentEntry::Skills` entries are omitted.** A `{ skills = "*" }`
//! entry is not an agent id — it expands to the connected integrations'
//! actions as searchable tools. Emitting a synthetic id here would invent a
//! delegate the host never authorized.
//!
