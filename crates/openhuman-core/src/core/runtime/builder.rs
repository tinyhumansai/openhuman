//! `CoreBuilder` → `CoreRuntime`: the embeddable composition surface.
//!
//! This is the first-class library API for hosting the OpenHuman core. It
//! splits the monolithic `run_server_inner` into two phases:
//!
//! 1. [`CoreBuilder::build`] — *initialization only*: register controllers, load
//!    the master key, seed the RPC bearer, initialize workspace-bound stores,
//!    and run the pure-registration part of [`bootstrap_core_runtime`]. No port
//!    is bound and `ServiceSet::none` / `ServiceSet::headless_api` start no
//!    background loops. After `build`, [`CoreRuntime::invoke`] can dispatch any
//!    RPC method in-process, and agent turns can run — so a harness-only embedder
//!    (`ServiceSet::none`) needs nothing more.
//! 2. *Transport + background services*: `openhuman_rpc::server::serve` binds
//!    the HTTP listener, mounts the router, fires the readiness signal, calls
//!    [`CoreRuntime::start_services`], and serves until shutdown. A runtime
//!    with no transport calls `start_services` itself.
//!
//! The host boot in `openhuman-rpc` (`host::{cli, desktop}`) and its
//! `run_server*` entry points build on this builder, so the desktop shell, the
//! standalone CLI, and any new embedder share one path.
//! See the pluggable-core work (`core::runtime`) for how this fits with
//! [`context`](crate::core::runtime::context) and `services`.
