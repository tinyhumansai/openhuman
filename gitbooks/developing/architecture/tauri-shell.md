# Tauri shell (`app/src-tauri/`)

The desktop host for OpenHuman: Tauri v2 + WebView, IPC commands, window management, and bridging to the embedded `openhuman-core` Rust runtime (core JSON-RPC). It does **not** duplicate the full domain stack; that lives in the repo-root Rust crate (`openhuman_core`, `src/main.rs`).

## Responsibilities

1. **Web UI**. Load the Vite build from `app/dist` (or dev server on port 1420).
2. **IPC**. Expose a small, explicit set of Tauri commands (see [Commands](#tauri-ipc-commands-app-src-tauri)).
3. **Core lifecycle**. Start the in-process core server and proxy JSON-RPC via `core_rpc_relay`.
4. **AI prompts on disk**. Resolve bundled `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` from resources / dev cwd for `ai_get_config` / `write_ai_config_file`.
5. **Window + tray**. Desktop window behavior and system tray (see `lib.rs`).

## Core process model

`app/package.json` `core:stage` is intentionally a no-op kept for script compatibility. The desktop app links the core in-process, so local builds no longer need a staged `openhuman-core-*` sidecar under `app/src-tauri/binaries/`.

## Stuck process recovery

Normal app quit runs teardown from `RunEvent::ExitRequested`: child webviews are closed before CEF shutdown, the embedded core's cancellation token is triggered, and the final process sweep sends `SIGTERM` to direct children before escalating holdouts with `SIGKILL` after a short grace period. Sweep summaries are logged as `[app] sweep: term=N kill=M total=K`; any nonzero `kill` count is a warning and means a child ignored graceful shutdown.

On macOS, hard exits (Force Quit, `SIGKILL`, renderer crash) can skip normal teardown. The next launch runs startup recovery before CEF cache preflight: it lists OpenHuman processes whose executable path belongs to the launching `.app/Contents`, skips the current process, sends `SIGTERM`, waits briefly, then `SIGKILL`s stragglers that still match the same pid+command. Logs use the `[startup-recovery]` prefix.

Startup recovery skips when `OPENHUMAN_CORE_REUSE_EXISTING=1` is set (so manual CLI-core reuse still works) and when the CEF `SingletonLock` is held by a live process (so the normal second-instance path can fail without killing the already-running app). The Tauri command `process_diagnostics_list_owned` returns the currently owned process list; the macOS implementation is bundle-scoped, Linux/Windows currently return empty.

## Tauri shell architecture (`app/src-tauri/`)

### Overview

The **`app/src-tauri`** crate (Rust package **`OpenHuman`**, binary **`OpenHuman`**) is a **desktop-only** host. It embeds the React UI, registers plugins (deep link, opener, OS, notifications, autostart, updater), manages the main window and tray, and **relays JSON-RPC** to the embedded core server.

Non-desktop targets fail at compile time (`compile_error!` in `lib.rs`).

### Directory layout (actual)

```
app/src-tauri/src/
├── lib.rs                 # `run()`, tray/menu actions, plugins, `generate_handler!`, core startup
├── main.rs                # Binary entry
├── core_process.rs        # CoreProcessHandle, embedded core server task
├── core_rpc.rs            # HTTP client to core JSON-RPC
├── commands/
│   ├── mod.rs             # Re-exports
│   ├── core_relay.rs      # `core_rpc_relay`, service-managed core bootstrap
│   ├── openhuman.rs       # Daemon host config, systemd-style service helpers
│   └── window.rs          # show/hide/minimize/close window
└── utils/
    ├── mod.rs
    └── dev_paths.rs       # Resolve bundled AI prompts paths
```

There is **no** `src-tauri/src/services/session_service.rs` in this tree; session semantics are handled in the web layer + backend + core as applicable.

### Data flow: UI → core

```
React (invoke)
    → core_rpc_relay { method, params, serviceManaged? }
        → core_rpc::call HTTP POST to OPENHUMAN_CORE_RPC_URL
            → embedded openhuman core server
```

`CoreProcessHandle` in `core_process.rs` owns the embedded server task; `commands/core_relay.rs` optionally ensures a **service-managed** core is running before relaying.

### Window and tray behavior

- The shell creates a tray icon at startup and wires actions to open the main window or quit.
- In daemon mode (`daemon` / `--daemon`), the main window is hidden on launch and can be reopened from tray actions.
- On macOS `RunEvent::Reopen` also restores and focuses the main window.
- Windows and Linux use the same tray actions (`Open OpenHuman`, `Quit`), with desktop-environment-specific tray rendering differences on some Linux setups.

### Bundled resources

`tauri.conf.json` bundles **`../../skills/skills`** and **`../../src/openhuman/agent/prompts`** so skills and prompt markdown ship with the app.

## Tauri IPC commands (`app/src-tauri`)

All commands are registered in **`app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`** inside `tauri::generate_handler![...]` (desktop build). Names below are the **Rust** command names (camelCase in JS via serde where applicable).

### Demo / diagnostics

| Command | Purpose                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `greet` | Demo string (safe to remove in production) |

### AI configuration (bundled prompts)

| Command                | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ai_get_config`        | Build `AIPreview` from resolved `SOUL.md` / `TOOLS.md` under bundled or dev `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` |
| `ai_refresh_config`    | Same read path as `ai_get_config` (refresh hook)                                                          |
| `write_ai_config_file` | Write a single `.md` under repo `src/openhuman/agent/prompts` (dev / safe filename checks)                |

### Core JSON-RPC relay

| Command          | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core_rpc_relay` | Body: `{ method, params?, serviceManaged? }` → forwards to local **`openhuman-core`** HTTP JSON-RPC (`core_rpc.rs`) |

Use **`app/src/services/coreRpcClient.ts`** (`callCoreRpc`) from the frontend.

### Window management

From **`commands/window.rs`** (names may vary slightly; see `lib.rs`):

| Command             | Purpose           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `show_window`       | Show main window  |
| `hide_window`       | Hide main window  |
| `toggle_window`     | Toggle visibility |
| `is_window_visible` | Query visibility  |
| `minimize_window`   | Minimize          |
| `maximize_window`   | Maximize          |
| `close_window`      | Close             |
| `set_window_title`  | Set title string  |

### OpenHuman daemon / service helpers

From **`commands/openhuman.rs`** (see source for exact payloads):

| Command                            | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `openhuman_get_daemon_host_config` | Read daemon host preferences (e.g. tray)       |
| `openhuman_set_daemon_host_config` | Persist daemon host preferences                |
| `openhuman_service_install`        | Install background service (platform-specific) |
| `openhuman_service_start`          | Start service                                  |
| `openhuman_service_stop`           | Stop service                                   |
| `openhuman_service_status`         | Query status                                   |
| `openhuman_service_uninstall`      | Uninstall service                              |

### Screen share picker (CEF / macOS)

From **`screen_capture/mod.rs`**. Backs the in-page `getDisplayMedia` shim in `webview_accounts/runtime.js`. Session-gated: the shim must open a session with a live user gesture before enumeration / thumbnail captures succeed. See issue #713 (picker UX) + #812 (session gating).

| Command                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `screen_share_begin_session`    | Open a 30s session from an account webview, after a `navigator.userActivation.isActive` gesture. Returns `{ token, sources }`. Rate-limited to 10/minute per account. |
| `screen_share_thumbnail`        | Capture a single source's thumbnail as base64 PNG. Requires a live token and an `id` that the session was issued for. macOS only; other platforms return an error.    |
| `screen_share_finalize_session` | Close the session. Called by the shim on Share or Cancel; safe to call with an unknown/expired token (no-op).                                                         |

### Workspace file links

From **`workspace_paths.rs`** (closes `#1402`). These commands accept workspace-relative paths only. The shell resolves each path against the active OpenHuman workspace, canonicalizes the target, and rejects traversal, absolute paths, URI-like prefixes, and symlink escapes before opening or reading anything.

| Command                  | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open_workspace_path`    | Open an existing workspace file or directory with the OS default app.  |
| `reveal_workspace_path`  | Reveal an existing workspace file or directory in the OS file manager. |
| `preview_workspace_text` | Read a capped UTF-8 text preview from an existing workspace file.      |

### Push-to-talk (PTT) hotkey + overlay

Registered in **`lib.rs`** (`ptt_hotkeys.rs` + `ptt_overlay.rs`). These commands manage the global push-to-talk shortcut and the floating overlay window.

| Command                | Signature                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `register_ptt_hotkey`  | `(shortcut: String) -> Result<(), String>`     | Register (or re-register) a global hotkey for push-to-talk. Emits Tauri events `ptt://start { session_id }` (key pressed) and `ptt://stop { session_id }` (key released). Returns an error string if the shortcut conflicts with dictation or if the OS rejects it (e.g. Wayland, Accessibility permission required on macOS). |
| `unregister_ptt_hotkey`| `() -> Result<(), String>`                     | Unregister the current PTT hotkey and tear down the overlay window.                                                                                                |
| `show_ptt_overlay`     | `(active: bool, session_id: u64) -> ()`        | Show (`active: true`) or hide (`active: false`) the floating PTT overlay window. The window is focus-stealing-free (`focus: false`). Called by `PttHotkeyManager.tsx` via `app/src/utils/tauriCommands/ptt.ts`. |

**Event flow:** `register_ptt_hotkey` wires the OS hotkey to fire `ptt://start` / `ptt://stop` Tauri events that `PttHotkeyManager.tsx` subscribes to via `@tauri-apps/api/event`. The manager forwards them into the `pttService` state machine which drives the audio capture → transcribe → chat-send pipeline.

**Conflict detection:** `register_ptt_hotkey` checks for overlap with the active dictation shortcuts before registering. If a conflict is detected it returns `"ConflictsWithDictation(<shortcut>)"` without registering anything, and the settings panel surfaces this as `pttSettings.errorConflictsWithDictation`.

### Synthetic input main-thread executor (native registry, not `invoke`)

Registered in **`lib.rs`** at startup under the event-bus native-request method
`computer.input_on_main_thread` (`INPUT_ON_MAIN_THREAD_METHOD`, defined in
`openhuman_core::openhuman::tools::computer::main_thread`). This is **not** a
`@tauri-apps/api` `invoke` command — it is an in-process native request the
**core** dispatches to the **shell** so synthetic input runs on the real app
main thread.

Why: enigo's macOS keyboard-layout lookup (`TSMGetInputSourceProperty`) traps
(`_dispatch_assert_queue_fail` / `EXC_BREAKPOINT`) and crashes the CEF host when
called off the main thread. The `mouse` / `keyboard` tools therefore never call
enigo on their tokio worker; they build a closure and dispatch it here, where
the shell runs it via `AppHandle::run_on_main_thread`.

| Field        | Shape                                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Method       | `computer.input_on_main_thread`                                                                    |
| Request      | `MainThreadInputOp { run: Box<dyn FnOnce() -> Result<String, String> + Send> }` (passed by value)  |
| Response     | `Result<String, String>` — `Ok(message)` on success, `Err(reason)` on failure                      |
| Availability | Desktop only. Headless / CLI builds register no executor; the core call then returns a clean `Err`. |

### Removed / not present

The following **do not** exist in the current `generate_handler!` list: `exchange_token`, `get_auth_state`, `socket_connect`, `start_telegram_login`. Authentication and sockets are handled in the **React** app and **core** process, not via these IPC names.

### Example: core RPC

```typescript
import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core";

const result = await invoke("core_rpc_relay", {
  request: {
    method: "your.rpc.method",
    params: { foo: "bar" },
    serviceManaged: false,
  },
});
```

## Core bridge & helpers (`app/src-tauri`)

This document replaces the old “SessionService / SocketService” split. The Tauri crate **does not** embed a duplicate Socket.io server or Telegram client; instead it focuses on **process management** and **HTTP JSON-RPC** to the **`openhuman-core`** binary.

### `CoreProcessHandle` (`core_process.rs`)

- Resolves the **`openhuman-core`** executable (staged under `binaries/` or `PATH` / dev layout).
- Starts or attaches to the core process and exposes its RPC URL (`OPENHUMAN_CORE_RPC_URL`).
- Used during app setup in `lib.rs` (`app.manage(core_handle)`).

### `core_rpc` (`core_rpc.rs`)

- HTTP client for the core’s JSON-RPC surface (localhost).
- Used by **`core_rpc_relay`** to forward `method` + `params` from the frontend.

### `commands/core_relay.rs`

- **`core_rpc_relay`**. ensures the core is running (in-process handle or **service-managed** path), then calls `core_rpc`.
- **`ensure_service_managed_core_running`**. bootstraps systemd/launchd-style service when RPC is down (platform-specific behavior inside core CLI).

### `commands/openhuman.rs`

- Daemon host JSON config (e.g. tray visibility) under the app data directory.
- Install/start/stop/status/uninstall helpers for the **openhuman** background service.

### `utils/dev_paths.rs`

- Resolves **`src/openhuman/agent/prompts`** for development and bundled resource paths for AI preview.

### `utils/tauriSocket.ts` (frontend)

Not in `src-tauri`, but **pairs** with the shell: the React app listens for Tauri events that mirror socket activity when using the Rust-side client. See `app/src/utils/tauriSocket.ts` and the [Frontend Services](frontend.md#services-layer) chapter.
